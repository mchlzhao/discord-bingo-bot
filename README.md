# BingoBot

### About

A Discord bot which allows users to play a bingo-like game with other server
members. The fun comes from being able to define custom bingo events, like for
instance, possible events of an upcoming sports game.

Players choose combos of events they think will all occur. They are able to win
only when all the events of any one combo occur. Of course, like in normal
Bingo, the win only counts once a player shouts "BINGO!"

### Todo

- Add more tests
- Create help command
- Implement confirmation system for some commands
- Delete view embeds after a short time to reduce spam
- Make number of combos, events per combo customisable
- Make bot command prefix customisable
- Show final events and progress on game finish
